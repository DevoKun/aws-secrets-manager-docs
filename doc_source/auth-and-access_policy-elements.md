# Specifying policy statement elements<a name="auth-and-access_policy-elements"></a>

The following section contains a brief overview of IAM permission policies from the perspective of Secrets Manager\. For more detail about IAM policy syntax, see the [AWS IAM Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Secrets Manager defines a set of API operations to interact with or manipulate a secret in some way\. To grant permissions for these operations, Secrets Manager defines a set of corresponding [actions](reference_iam-permissions.md) you can specify in a policy\. For example, Secrets Manager defines actions to work on a secret, such as `CreateSecret`, `GetSecretValue`, `ListSecrets`, and `RotateSecret`\.

A policy document must have a `Version` element\. We recommend always using the latest version to ensure you can use all of the available features\. As of this writing, the only available version is `2012-10-17` \(the latest version\)\. 

In addition, a secret policy document must have one `Statement` element with one or more statements in an array\. Each statement can consist of up to six elements:
+ **Sid** – \(Optional\) You can use the `Sid` as a statement identifier, an arbitrary string identifying the statement\. The string cannot contain spaces\.
+ **Effect** – \(Required\) Use this keyword to specify if the policy statement allows or denies the action on the resource\. If you don't explicitly allow access to a resource, access is *implicitly* denied\. You also can explicitly deny access to a resource\. You might do this to ensure that a user can't perform the specified action on the specified resource, even if a different policy grants access\. You should understand that multiple statements overlap, explicit deny in a statement overrides any other statements that explicitly allow\. Explicit allow statements override the implicit deny present by default\.
+ **Action** – \(Required\) Use this keyword to identify the actions you want to allow or deny\. These actions usually, but not always, correspond one\-to\-one with the available operations\. For example, depending on the specified `Effect`, `secretsmanager:PutSecretValue` either allows or denies the user permissions to perform the Secrets Manager `PutSecretValue` operation\.
+ **Resource** – \(Required\) In an identity\-based policy attached to a user, group, or role, you use this keyword to specify the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the resource for the applicable policy statement\. If you don't want the statement to restrict access to a specific resource, then you can use "\*", and the resulting statement restricts only actions\. In a resource\-based policy attached to a secret, the resource must *always* be "\*"\.
+ **Principal** – \(Required in a resource\-based policy only\) For resource\-based policies attached directly to a secret, you specify the user, role, account, service, or other entity you want to receive permissions\. This element isn't valid in an identity\-based policy\. In identity\-based policies, the user or role with the attached policy automatically and implicitly becomes the principal\.
+ **Condition** – \(Optional\) Use this keyword to specify additional conditions that must be true for the statement to "match" and the `Effect` to apply\.
