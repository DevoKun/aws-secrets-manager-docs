# Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager<a name="terms-concepts"></a>

The following terms and concepts are important for understanding AWS Secrets Manager and how it works\.

## Secret<a name="term_secret"></a>

In Secrets Manager, a secret is typically a set of credentials \(user name and password\) and the connection details that you use to access a [secured service](#term_secured-service)\. You want to store these securely, and ensure that only authorized users can access them\. Secrets Manager always stores the secret text in an encrypted form and encrypts the secret in transit\. 

Secrets Manager uses IAM permission policies to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the secret\. You can attach these policies to users or roles, and specify which secrets those users can access\. For more details about controlling access to your secrets, see [Authentication and Access Control for AWS Secrets Manager](auth-and-access.md)\.

When storing credentials, different secured services might require different pieces of information\. Secrets Manager provides this flexibility by storing the secret as key\-value pairs of text strings\. If you choose a database that Secrets Manager knows how to work with, then the key\-value pairs are defined for you according to the requirements of the rotation function for the chosen database\. The pairs are formatted as [JSON](http://json.org) text\. If you choose some other service or database that Secrets Manager doesn't provide the Lambda function for, then you can specify your secret as JSON key\-value pairs that you define\. 

The resulting stored encrypted secret text might then resemble the following example:

```
{
  "host" : "ProdServer-01.databases.example.com",
  "port" : "8888",
  "username"   : "administrator",
  "password"   : "My-P@ssw0rd!F0r+Th3_Acc0unt",
  "dbname"     : "MyDatabase",
  "engine"     : "mysql"
}
```

If you use the command\-line tools or the API, you can also store binary data in the secret\. Binary data isn't supported by the Secrets Manager console\.

Secrets Manager can automatically rotate your secret for you on a schedule that you specify\. You can rotate credentials without interrupting the service if you choose to store a complete set of credentials for a user or account, instead of only the password\. If you change or rotate only the password, then the old password immediately becomes obsolete, and clients must immediately start using the new password or fail\. If you can instead create a new user with a new password, or at least alternate between two users, then the old user and password can continue to operate side by side with the new one, until you choose to deprecate the old one\. This gives you a window of time where all of your clients can continue to work while you test and validate the new credentials\. Only after your new credentials pass testing do you commit all of your clients to using the new credentials and remove the old credentials\.

**Supported Databases**  
If you use the Secrets Manager console and specify that the secret is for [one of the databases that Secrets Manager natively supports](intro.md#full-rotation-support), then Secrets Manager manages all of that structure and parsing for you\. The console prompts you for the details that the specific type of database needs\. Behind the scenes, Secrets Manager constructs the structure that's needed, stores the information, and then parses it back into easy\-to\-understand text information when you retrieve it\. 

**Other Databases or Services**  
If you instead specify that the secret is for a "custom" database or service, then what you do with the secret text after you retrieve it and how you interpret it is up to you\. The Secrets Manager console accepts your secret as key\-value strings, and automatically converts them into a JSON structure for storage\. If you retrieve the secret in the console, Secrets Manager automatically parses the secret back into key\-value text strings for you to view\. If you retrieve the secret programmatically, then you can use an appropriate JSON parsing library \(available for almost every programming language\), to parse the secret in any way that's useful to you\. If a secret requires more than per\-secret limit of 10240 bytes you could split your key\-value pairs between two secrets and concatenate them back together when you retrieve them\.

### Basic Structure of a Secrets Manager Secret<a name="basic-structure"></a>

In Secrets Manager, a secret contains not only the encrypted secret text, but also several metadata elements that describe the secret and define how Secrets Manager should handle the secret:

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/images/secret-concept.png)
+ **Metadata – Details about the secret**
  + Basic information that includes the name of the secret, a description, and the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) that serves as a unique identifier\. 
  + The ARN of the AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt and decrypt the protected text in the secret\. If this isn't present, Secrets Manager uses the default AWS KMS key for the account\. 
  + Information about how frequently the key is automatically [rotated](#term_rotation) and what Lambda function to use to perform the rotation\.
  + A user\-provided set of [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html)\. Tags are key\-value pairs that you can attach to AWS resources for organizing, logical grouping, and [cost allocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what)\.
+ **Versions – A collection of one or more [versions](#term_version) of the encrypted secret text**
  + Although you typically only have one version of the secret active at a time, multiple versions can exist while you rotate a secret on the database or service\. A new version is created whenever you need to change the secret, such as when you change the password\.
  + Each version holds its own copy of the encrypted secret value\.
  + Each version can have one or more [staging labels](#term_staging-label) attached that identify where that version is in the secret's rotation cycle\.

## Secured Service<a name="term_secured-service"></a>

The secured service is the service, such as a database or other service running on a network server, whose access is controlled by the credentials stored in the secret\. The secured service can refer to a single server or a large group of servers that all share the same access method\. You need the secret to successfully access the secured service\. The secret contains all of the information that a client needs to access the secured service\. This guide uses the term "secured service" as a generic term to represent all of the different types of databases and services whose secrets can be protected by AWS Secrets Manager\. 

## Rotation<a name="term_rotation"></a>

Rotation is the process where you periodically change the secret to make it more difficult for an attacker to access the secured service\. With Secrets Manager, you don't have to manually change the secret and update it on all of your clients\. Instead, Secrets Manager uses an AWS Lambda function to perform all of the steps of rotation for you on a regular schedule\.

Imagine a large set of clients that are all running an application that accesses a database \(the [secured service](#term_secured-service)\)\. Instead of hardcoding the credentials into your app, the app calls Secrets Manager to request the secret's details whenever they're needed\. When it's time to rotate the secret, the Lambda rotation function automatically performs the following steps:

1. The rotation function contacts the secured service's authentication system and creates a new set of credentials to access the database\. The credentials typically consist of a user name, a password, and connection details, but can vary from system to system\. Secrets Manager stores these new credentials as the secret text in a new [version](#term_version) of the secret that gets the `AWSPENDING` staging label attached\.

1. The rotation function then tests the `AWSPENDING` version of the secret to ensure that the credentials work, and that they grant the required level of access to the secured service\. 

1. If the tests succeed, the rotation function then moves the label `AWSCURRENT` to the new version to mark it as the "default" version\. This causes all of the clients to start using this version of the secret instead of the old version\. The function also assigns the label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the old version, which marks it as the "last known good" version\. The version that previously had the `AWSPREVIOUS` staging label now has none, and is therefore deprecated\.

You can trigger the Lambda rotation function manually when you choose **Rotate secret** in the console, or you can trigger it automatically every ***n*** days by specifying a rotation schedule\. If you use [one of the AWS databases that Secrets Manager natively supports](intro.md#full-rotation-support), then Secrets Manager provides a Lambda function that knows how to rotate that database's credentials\. This function performs basic rotation for you automatically or you can customize the function to support an advanced custom rotation strategy\.

If you choose to create a secret for a custom service, then you must create the Lambda function yourself\. In the code of the function, you determine how to compose the JSON structure and parse it in your function\.

No matter what service or database your secret is for, the Lambda rotation function for the secret must be able to access both your database/service and a Secrets Manager service endpoint\. If the Lambda rotation function and database/service reside in a VPC provided by Amazon VPC, then you must configure the VPC with either a [VPC service endpoint for Secrets Manager](rotation-network-rqmts.md), or [direct Internet connectivity by using a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html), to allow access to the public Secrets Manager service endpoint\.

## Version<a name="term_version"></a>

Multiple versions of a secret exist to support [rotation of a secret](#term_rotation)\. Different versions are distinguished by their [staging labels](#term_staging-label)\. For most scenarios, you don't have to worry about versions of the secret\. Secrets Manager and the provided Lambda rotation function manage these details for you\. However, if you create your own Lambda rotation function, your code must manage multiple versions of a secret and move the staging labels between versions appropriately\. Versions also each have a unique identifier \(typically a [UUID](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID) value\) that always stays with the same version, unlike staging labels that you can move between versions\. 

You typically configure your clients to always ask for the "default" version of the secret\. This is the version that has the `AWSCURRENT` label attached\. Other versions can exist, but they're only accessed if you specifically request a specific version ID or staging label\. If you ask for the secret value and you don't specify either a version ID or a staging label, then by default you get the version with the staging label `AWSCURRENT`\.

During rotation, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret and attaches the staging label `AWSPENDING`\. The rotation function uses the `AWSPENDING` version to identify that version until it passes testing\. After the rotation function verifies that the new credentials work, it moves the label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the older version that has `AWSCURRENT`, moves the label `AWSCURRENT` to the newer `AWSPENDING` version, and finally removes `AWSPENDING`\.

For more information about how staging labels work to support rotation, see [Rotating Your AWS Secrets Manager Secrets](rotating-secrets.md)\.

Each version that's maintained for a secret has the following elements:
+ A unique ID for the version\.
+ A collection of staging labels that can be used to identify the version \(unique within the secret\)\. A version with no staging labels is considered deprecated and subject to deletion by Secrets Manager\.
+ The secret text that's encrypted and stored\.

Whenever you query for the encrypted secret value, you can specify the version of the secret that you want\. If you don't specify a version \(either by version ID or staging label\), Secrets Manager defaults to the version with the staging label `AWSCURRENT` attached\. This is the one staging label that's guaranteed to always be attached to one version of the secret\.

## Staging Label<a name="term_staging-label"></a>

Secrets Manager uses staging labels to enable you to identify different [versions](#term_version) of a secret during [rotation](#term_rotation)\. A staging label is a simple text string\. Whenever you query for the encrypted secret value, you can specify the version of the secret that you want\. If you don't specify a version \(either by version ID or staging label\), Secrets Manager defaults to the version with the staging label `AWSCURRENT` attached\. This is the one staging label that's guaranteed to always be attached to one version of the secret\. See the brief introduction to [rotation](#term_rotation) for an example of how this can work\.

A version of a secret can have from 0 to 20 staging labels attached\.

A staging label can be attached to only one version of a secret at a time\. Two versions of the secret can't have the same staging label\. When you attach a staging label to a version and it's already attached to a different version, you must also specify the version it needs to be removed from, or you get an error\.

One version of the secret must **always** have the staging label `AWSCURRENT`\. This is enforced by the API operations\. The Lambda rotation functions that are provided by Secrets Manager automatically maintain the `AWSPENDING`, `AWSCURRENT`, and `AWSPREVIOUS` labels on the appropriate versions\.
