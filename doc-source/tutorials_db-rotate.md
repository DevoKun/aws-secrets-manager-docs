# Tutorial: Rotating a Secret for an AWS Database<a name="tutorials_db-rotate"></a>

In this tutorial, you create a secret for an AWS database and configure it to rotate on a schedule\. You trigger one rotation manually, and then confirm that the new version of the secret continues to provide access\.

**[Step 1: Set Up a Test Database](#tut-db-rotate-step1)**  
In this step, you create a test database in Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\)\. For this tutorial, the test database runs MySQL\.

**[Step 2: Create Your Secret](#tut-db-rotate-step2)**  
Next, you use the Secrets Manager console to create your secret and populate it with the initial user name and password for your MySQL database\. You test the secret by using the returned credentials to sign in to the database\.

**[Step 3: Validate Your Initial Secret](#tut-db-rotate-step3)**  
In step 3, you use your new secret to test the credentials and ensure that you can use them to connect to your database\.

**[Step 4: Configure Rotation for Your Secret](#tut-db-rotate-step4)**  
In step 4, you enable rotation for the secret and perform the initial rotation\.

**[Step 5: Verify Successful Rotation](#tut-db-rotate-step5)**  
In this step, after the initial rotation completes, you repeat the validation steps to show that the new credentials generated during rotation continue to allow you to access the database\.

**[Step 6: Clean Up](#tut-db-rotate-step6)**  
In the final step, we remove the Amazon RDS database instance and the secret to avoid incurring any unnecessary costs\.

## Prerequisites<a name="tut_db-rotate-prereqs"></a>

This tutorial assumes that you have access to an AWS account\. It also assumes that you can sign in to AWS as a user with full permissions to operate AWS Secrets Manager and Amazon RDS, in either the console or by using the equivalent commands in the AWS CLI\.

The tutorial uses a MySQL client tool to interact with the database and configure users, and to check status\. The installation instructions are shown at the appropriate point in the steps that follow\.

The tutorial also uses a Linux JSON parsing tool called **jq**\. To download the tool, see [jq on the GitHub website](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\.

**Important**  
For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses jq to parse the secret value into environment variables to allow for easy command line manipulation\. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment\. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables\.  
Also, the database that's configured in this tutorial is open to the public internet on port 3306 \(again for simplicity in setup for the tutorial\)\. To complete this tutorial, you must be able to access the MySQL database from your internet\-connected computer by using the MySQL client tool\. To configure production servers securely, we recommend that you follow the guidance in the Lambda and Amazon EC2 VPC documentation\.

**Important**  
For rotation to work, your network environment must permit the Lambda rotation function to communicate with both your database and the Secrets Manager service\. Because this tutorial configures your database with public internet access, Lambda automatically configures your rotation function to access the database through its public IP address\. If you instead block public internet access to your database instance, then you must configure the Lambda function to run in the same VPC as the database instance\. Then you must either [configure your VPC with a private Secrets Manager endpoint](rotation-network-rqmts.md), or [configure the VPC with public internet access by using a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html), so that the Lambda rotation function can access the public Secrets Manager endpoint\.

## Required Permissions<a name="tut_db-rotate-perms"></a>

To successfully run this tutorial, you must have all of the permissions associated with the [SecretsManagerReadWrite AWS managed policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite)\. You must also have permission to create an IAM role and attach a permission policy to it\. You can grant either the [IAMFullAccess AWS managed policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess), or explicitly assign `iam:CreateRole` and `iam:AttachRolePolicy`\. 

**Warning**  
The `iam:CreateRole` and `iam:AttachRolePolicy` enable a user to effectively grant themselves any permission, so grant these only to trusted users in an account\.

## Step 1: Set Up a Test Database<a name="tut-db-rotate-step1"></a>

In this step, you sign in to your account and set up a MySQL database in Amazon RDS\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. If you see the **Amazon Relational Database Service** welcome page, choose **Get started now**\.

   If you see your dashboard, choose **Instances**, and then choose **Launch DB instance**\.

1. On the **Select engine** page, choose **MySQL**, select **Only enable options eligible for RDS Free Usage Tier**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Specify DB details** page, in the **Instance specifications** section, leave all of the settings at their default values\.

1. In the **Settings** section, make the following choices:
   + **DB instance identifier**: **MyTestDatabaseInstance**
   + **Master username**: **adminuser**\.
   + **Master password**: Type a secure initial password, and repeat it in the **Confirm password** box\. *Be sure to remember this password\.* You'll need it when you create your secret in Step 2\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Configure advanced settings** page, in the **Network & Security** section, set **Public accessibility** to **Yes**\. This setting automatically adds a public Elastic IP address to the database instance\. Leave all other network settings on their default values\.
**Note**  
These settings are the minimal settings you need to get the tutorial working\. If you require the use of a private VPC, then the Lambda function must be configured to run in that VPC\. Next, you must either [configure your VPC with a private Secrets Manager endpoint](rotation-network-rqmts.md) or [configure the VPC with public Internet access by using a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) so that the Lambda rotation function can access the public Secrets Manager endpoint\.

1. In the **Database options** section, for **Database name**, type **MyTestDatabase**\. Leave the other settings at default values\.

1. In the **Backup** section, set the **Backup retention** period to **0 days** to disable backups\. 

1. Leave the settings in all other sections at their default values\.

1. Choose **Launch DB instance**\.

1. Choose **View DB instance summary**, and wait until the instance is up and running before proceeding with the next step\. It can take several minutes to complete\.

1. When the **Summary** section's **DB instance status** shows **Available**, refresh the page, and then scroll down to the **Connect** section\.

1. In the **Connect** section, choose the name of the security group that is of the type **CIDR/IP \- Inbound**\. This opens the Amazon EC2 console for that security group\.

1. At the bottom of the page, choose the **Inbound** tab, and then choose **Edit**\.

   There's one existing rule that enables access to the database from the current VPC\. You need to enable access to the database from the public internet so that your MySQL client tool and your hypothetical customers running apps can all access this database\. 
**Warning**  
The following step opens up your test database to the internet\. This isn't a secure configuration, but it's provided here to make the configuration steps for this tutorial simpler\. For a secure setup, block public access to your database instance\. Then, configure the Lambda function to run in the same VPC as your database instance\. You must then either [configure your VPC with a Secrets Manager endpoint](rotation-network-rqmts.md), or [configure the VPC with public internet access by using a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)\. This enables the Lambda rotation function to access a Secrets Manager endpoint\. When you're done with these tutorials on this database, we recommend that you remove the rule that you create in the next step\.

1. Under **Source**, change it from **Custom** to **Anywhere**\. Leave the Port Range at **3306**, which is the default for MySQL\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Step 2: Create Your Secret<a name="tut-db-rotate-step2"></a>

In this step, you create a secret in Secrets Manager, and populate it with the details of your test database and the credentials of your master user\. 

**To create your secret**

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)\.

1. Ensure that your console is set to the same region as you created the Amazon RDS MySQL database in the previous step\.

1. Choose **Store a new secret**\.

1. On the **Create Secret** page, in the **Select secret type** section, choose **Credentials for RDS database**\.

1. For **User name**, type **adminuser** to match the name of the master user that you previously provided in Step 1\.5\.

1. For **Password**, type the same password that you provided for **adminuser** in Step 1\.5\.

1. For **Select the encryption key**, leave it set to **DefaultEncryptionKey**\. If you use a customer master key \(CMK\) instead of the default for the account, then you can be charged for the use of that CMK\.

1. For **Select which RDS database this secret will access**, choose the instance **MyTestDatabaseInstance** that you created in Step 1\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Secret name and description** section, for **Secret name**, type **MyTestDatabaseMasterSecret**\.

1. In the **Configure automatic rotation** section, leave rotation disabled for now\. Choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Review** section, verify your details, and then choose **Store**\.

   You're returned to the list of secrets, which now includes your new secret\.

## Step 3: Validate Your Initial Secret<a name="tut-db-rotate-step3"></a>

Before you configure your secret to rotate automatically, you should verify that the information in your secret is correct and can be used to connect to the database\. In this tutorial, we describe how to install a Linux\-based MySQL client component\. Then we run a Linux command that retrieves the secret and connects to the database using the credentials it finds in the secret\.

If you're running this tutorial on some other platform, you might have to translate these commands into equivalents for your platform\. At the very least, you can retrieve the secret by using either the AWS CLI or the Secrets Manager console\. Then cut and paste the user name and password into whatever MySQL database client you use\.

1. Install a MySQL client\. For example:

   ```
   $ sudo yum install mysql
   ...
   Installed:
     mysql.noarch 0:5.5-1.3.amzn1
   
   Dependency Installed:
     mysql55.x86_64 0:5.5.24-1.24.amzn1                                      mysql55-common.x86_64 0:5.5.24-1.24.amzn1
   
   Complete!
   $
   ```

1. Run commands that retrieve the secret and store them temporarily\.

   ```
   $ secret=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id MyTestDatabaseMasterSecret | jq .SecretString | jq fromjson)
   $ user=$(echo $secret | jq -r .username)
   $ password=$(echo $secret | jq -r .password)
   $ endpoint=$(echo $secret | jq -r .host)
   $ port=$(echo $secret | jq -r .port)
   ```

   The first command retrieves the secret from Secrets Manager\. Then it pulls the `SecretString` field out of the JSON response and stores it in an environment variable\. Each of the commands that follow parses out one additional credential piece or connection detail, and stores it in a separate environment variable\.

1. Run a command that uses the parsed details to access your database\.

   ```
   $ mysql -h $endpoint -u $user -P $port -p$password
   Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

   mysql>
   ```
**Troubleshooting tip:**  
If the `mysql` command fails to connect to the database then check the security group attached to the VPC that the database is running in\. The default rules in a security group enable all outbound traffic, but they block all inbound traffic except for the traffic which you explicitly allow by defining a rule\. If your computer is running on the public internet then your security group must enable inbound traffic from the internet \(any address\) on the TCP port that you configured your database to communicated on\. This is typically port 3306\. If you configure MySQL to use a different TCP port, ensure that you update the security rule to match\. 

1. At the `mysql>` prompt, run a command that verifies your connection to the database by using the credentials from the secret\. Ensure that the **Current user** in the output is the user that's specified in your secret\.

   ```

   ```

1. Close the connection with the following command:

   ```
   mysql> quit
   Bye
   ```

## Step 4: Configure Rotation for Your Secret<a name="tut-db-rotate-step4"></a>

Now that the initial credentials in your secret have been validated, you can configure and start your first rotation\.

1. In the Secrets Manager console, choose the secret **MyTestDatabaseMasterSecret**\.

1. On the secret details page, in the **Rotation configuration** section, choose **Edit rotation**\.

1. On the **Edit rotation configuration** page, choose **Enable automatic rotation**\.

1. For **Select rotation interval**, choose **30 days**\.

1. Under **Select which secret will be used to perform the rotation**, choose **Use this secret**\.

1. Choose **Save**\. Secrets Manager begins to configure rotation for your secret, including creating the Lambda rotation function and attaching a role that enables Secrets Manager to invoke the function\. 

1. Stay on the browser page with the **Rotation is being configured** message, until it changes to **Your secret MyTestDatabaseMasterSecret has been successfully stored and secret rotation is enabled\.**

## Step 5: Verify Successful Rotation<a name="tut-db-rotate-step5"></a>

Now that you've rotated the secret, you can confirm that the new credentials in the secret work to connect with your database\.

1. Run the commands that retrieve the secret and store them temporarily in environment variables\.

   ```
   $ secret=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id MyTestDatabaseMasterSecret | jq .SecretString | jq fromjson)
   $ user=$(echo $secret | jq -r .username)
   $ password=$(echo $secret | jq -r .password)
   $ endpoint=$(echo $secret | jq -r .host)
   $ port=$(echo $secret | jq -r .port)
   ```

1. Using the same MySQL client that you installed previously, run the command that uses the parsed details to access your database\.

   ```
   $ mysql -h $endpoint -u $user -P $port -p$password
   Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

   ```

## Step 6: Clean Up<a name="tut-db-rotate-step6"></a>

**Important**  
If you intend to also perform the tutorial [Tutorial: Rotating a User Secret with a Master Secret](tutorials_db-rotate-master.md), then don't perform these steps until you complete that tutorial as well\.

Because databases and secrets can incur charges on your AWS bill, you should remove the database instance and the secret that you created in this tutorial after you're finished experimenting\.

**To delete the secret**

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)\.

1. In the list of secrets, choose the **MyTestDatabaseSecret** secret that you created for this tutorial\.

1. Choose **Actions**, then choose **Delete secret**\.

1. In the **Schedule secret deletion** dialog box, for **Enter a waiting period**, type **7**\. This is the minimum value allowed\.

1. Choose **Schedule deletion**\.

   After the number of days in the recovery window elapses, Secrets Manager removes the secret permanently\.

**To delete the database instance**

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

1. In the list of available instances, choose the **MyTestDatabaseInstance** instance that you created for this tutorial\.

1. Choose **Instance actions**, and then choose **Delete**\.

1. On the **Delete DB Instance** page, in the **Options** section, for **Create final snapshot**, choose **No**\.

1. Select the acknowledgement that all of your data will be lost, and then choose **Delete**\.
